# keyword-blocker

## Description

This script masks the occurences of the supplied keywords from a text file. Works on a directory too and will target all the readable files in the directory.

## Setup

1. Clone the script directory to your local machine
2. It is recommended, but not compulsory, to run the next steps in a Python Virtual Environment. You may create a Virtual Environment by running the following command inside the cloned directory: `python3 -m venv env` and then activate the Virtual Environment by running `. env/bin/activate`. You may deactivate the Virtual Environment later on by running the `deactivate` command.
3. Install the script dependencies by running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the script by typing in the command `python3 script.py <path_to_the_text_file>`

## Supported script arguments

The script supports commandline arguments. You may find all about them by typing in `python3 script.py --help`
